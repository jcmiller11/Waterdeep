After [[Dalakhar]] got the stone, he was being chased by the [[Zhentarim]] towards the party's Tavern but a [[Nimblewright]] working for [[Yalah Gralhund]] threw a fireball gem and blew up a bunch of people including the [[Zhentarim]]. Yalah had been working with them but secretly took a deal with [[Mr. X]] for power in return for betraying the Zhentarim and getting him the [[Stone of Golorr.]] Urstul got the Stone and took it to [[Gralhund Villa]], but Yalah took the stone, which resulted in the Zhentarim led by [[Urstul Floxin]] attacking the Gralhunds to get it back. Unfortunately the Stone was taken by the [[Nimblewright]] to a friend in [[Mistshore]], a neighborhood in the [[Dock Ward]].
