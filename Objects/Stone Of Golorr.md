A magical intelligent artifact necessary to gain access to the Vault hiding the [[Lost Dragons of Neverember]].  The stone was once an Aboleth, and it retains some amount of psychic power that it can use to control or compel those who seek its secret knowledge. The secret knowledge is the location of the Vault, which was underneath a Theatre in the Castle Ward known as [[The Pink Flumph]]. The stone also knows the 3 keys required to open the vault, which are a beholder eyestalk, a shapeshifter, and a dragon's scale.
