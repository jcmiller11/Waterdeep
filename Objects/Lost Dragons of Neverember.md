The Lost Dragons of Neverember are a massive trove of 500,000 Dragons, or Gold Pieces. They were embezzled by [[Dagult Neverember]], the former [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] and hidden in a vault underground. Eventually, Dagult's crimes caught up to him and he fled town as a fugitive, but hoped to someday secure and retrieve that massive Hoard. He had a vault constructed and hired [[Aurinax]] the Gold Dragon to guard it. Entry to the Vault required the [[Stone Of Golorr]] as well as the knowledge of 3 other keys that would open the door. Eventually the [[Party]] found the vault, got inside, and found the treasure, but they failed to retrieve the treasure. Instead they talked to [[Vajra Blackstaff]] and she recovered the gold for the city.
