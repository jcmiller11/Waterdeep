A famous adventurer, and a member of [[Force Grey]]. Meloon has done some impressive adventuring feats, including surviving the Undermountain (although only barely and without anything to show for it but his life), and has a reputation around[[The Yawning Portal]] and even some parts of [[Waterdeep]].

Meloon is being controlled by an Intellect Devourer who works for the [[X Guild]] and is friends with [[Gilgamesh]].

He owns an intelligent axe named [[Azuredge]]. The axe wants Meloon to give it to a new owner.
