Owner of the Old Xoblob Shop. Xoblob is a deep gnome, who is purple and obsessed with purple. His whole shop is purple and all they do is sell purple stuff. There's a taxidermied beholder in the store window, and Xoblob says that the beholder's name was Xoblob. Xoblob bought the store, already called the Old Xoblob Shop, and already complete with the stuffed window beholder, and eventually changed his name to Xoblob after everyone kept thinking he was the titular store owner. He's a member of the [[X Guild]]. Xoblob has delusions resulting from inhaling some gas spores underground one time and occasionally has beholder dreams.

He attacked the party after they revealed to him that they had the [[Stone Of Golorr]]. The party burnt down the shop during combat but managed to save Xoblob before he perished in the fire.
