Halaster Blackcloak is an ancient and powerful wizard. Before [[Waterdeep]] was built, an ancient elf kingdom used to exist here, sealed and protected by powerful magic, some of which still remains, albeit in a strange and twisted form. The elf kingdom disappeared, and its twisted magic somehow caught the eye of Halaster, who brought with him several disciples to explore this strange place. The mountain itself used to be home to dwarven mithril mines but was abandoned at some point, and as Halaster explored these ruins and caverns, the magic of [[Undermountain]] compelled him to delve deeper and stay longer, much to the chagrin of his disciples. The disciples hoped to  learn great power from Halaster, but his newfound obsession made that task much more difficult for them, and he grew distant and mad, earning the title of The Mad Mage. The [[Undermountain]] became a legendary dungeon, and few ever ventured inside, but one day, a man by the name of Durnan emerged triumphant and rich with treasure. He built a tavern around the entrance to the [[Undermountain]] and named it [[The Yawning Portal]].
