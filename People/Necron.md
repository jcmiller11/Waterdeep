A powerful Tech-Demon, a powerful type of demon that displays powers related to the manipulation and creation of metal, tools, and machines. Necron is worshipped by various cults and occasionally craftsmen and artisans. Necron is often invoked in evil rituals of golem creation and is interested in the corruption of flesh and steel. Petitioners can seek his knowledge, power, or favor to assist their strange and often forbidden projects.

A faction of worshippers known as the Machine Tide serves the desires of Necron and seeks to create a new race of cyborg hybrid creatures they want to call technodemons. The Lord of Blades is said to have some tendrils in the group as well. The Machine Tide had some involvement in the creation of [[Relic]] and want to retrieve him for some nefarious purpose.

Necron is currently on some unknown mission.
