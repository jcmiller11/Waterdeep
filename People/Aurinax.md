An Adult Gold Dragon. Aurinax lives in a secret vault underneath [[Waterdeep]], in the ruins of a lost dwarven civilization. He helped the city to fight off a demon invasion and as a result is an honored citizen of Waterdeep, and was given a powerful dragonstaff as thanks. He was hired by [[Dagult Neverember]] to guard the [[Lost Dragons of Neverember]] not long before [[Dagult Neverember]] was run out of town. He was annoyed by the party when they showed up.
