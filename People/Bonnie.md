Bonnie is a Doppelganger Barmaid. She's friends with [[Diedre]], and few others know her secret, as doppelgangers are distrusted by many, and rightfully so. They often prey on people for incomprehensible reasons. Bonnie is part of a gang of 'pacifist' doppelgangers that wants to live at peace with everyone. [[Durnan]] hired her to give aid to the doppelgangers. Her gang consists of 3 other doppelgangers who obey her leadership.
