Relic is a Warforged Wizard. He has lost his memories, but remembers coming to consciousness in a sewer. His body is covered in strange Abyssal Runes, and is plagued by some sort of mysterious darkness, possibly a demon or shadow entity. Relic has occasional memories of being a human, but doesn't have many specifics about anything before the sewer. He is a considerable wizard but he has strange manifestations of a dark power as a result of his dark origins. He is currently a melted husk with a consciousness after losing a fight to [[Aurinax]], an Adult Gold Dragon.
