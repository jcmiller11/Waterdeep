The Yawning Portal is a Tavern owned by Durnan. It was built around the entrance to the [[Undermountain]] in [[Waterdeep]]. The Yawning Portal is one of the most famous watering holes in town, and adventurers love to hang out, talk shop, and even challenge the Undermountain. In the center of the tavern is a massive well shaft with a winch system that can lower a bucket and a rope down the 100 or so feet to the bottom of the shaft, which is considered the entrance to the Undermountain.

Notable locals at The Yawning Portal are:
[[Bonnie]] the Barmaid, who is secretly a doppelganger. She recently got a new job at the Trollskull Manor Tavern.
[[Threestrings]] the Halfling Bard, a member of the [[Harpers]].
[[Meloon Wardragon]] the Human Adventurer, a member of [[Force Grey]].
[[Yagra Stonefist]] the Half Orc Mercenary working for the [[Zhentarim]].
[[Obaya Uday]] the Human Cleric of Waukeen.
[[Floon Blagmar]] the local hunk.
[[Renaer Neverember]] the son of disgraced Open Lord [[Dagult Neverember]].
[[Volothamp Geddarm]] the famous hack.

The adventure began here when the [[Party]], which had recently formed, tried to break up a fight between [[Yagra Stonefist]] and [[Krentz]], a member of the [[X Guild]] and then assisted [[Durnan]] in slaying a troll that climbed up from the [[Undermountain]]. They met [[Volothamp Geddarm]] and were hired to find Floon. Since then they've returned a few times for inspiration and to talk to friends. They also hired [[Bonnie]] to work in their tavern.
