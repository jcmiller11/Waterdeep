The Undermountain is a massive megadungeon that was built ages ago by a Wizard named [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. This powerful and crazy wizard is said to have been driven mad by his exposure to the Undermountain and it was this that compelled him to create it and keep expanding it out. The Undermountain is poorly understood and only a scarce few adventurers can say that they've made it out with their lives. It is said there exists an entire city down there, known as [[Skullport]].
