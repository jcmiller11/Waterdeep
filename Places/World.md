Let's just call it Khorvaire but it has some of the Gods and Places from Faerun.

We don't know too much about the world yet, but here's what we know. There's a Waterdeep, and there's a Baldur's Gate. They exist somewhere in Khorvaire, which is the main continent on Eberron.

Eberron is a 3 layered plane of existence that includes the Material Plane, the Astral Plane, and the Underdark, the Dragons of the Earth, Sky, and Deep.
