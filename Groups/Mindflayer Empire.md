In the Underdark near Waterdeep is a massive complex of caverns and structures under the control of the Mindflayer Empire, territory that includes old Duergar mines as well as beautifully preserved underground habitats left by elves, and even some pockets of Drow Strongholds. The Mindflayer Empire is a powerful threat to the entire multiverse, and in recent times has taken to forging deals and agreements with the [[X Guild]].

Illbisk-5 is the designation of this particular mindflayer stronghold, named after the Elder Brain controlling the operations of the entire hivemind.

Illbisk-5 is working on unleashing a magical calamity that could rip the city in half, sending all manner of psionic horrors and otherworldly creatures free on the material plane by opening a psychic gateway within the minds of the people of Waterdeep through a strange and complicated plot involving linking their minds and then overloading the collective consciousness with massive surges of psionic energy.

Maybe their plan involves poisoning the water supply or something.

Notable Members of the Mindflayer Empire:

[[Meloon Wardragon]], a famous adventurer.
