A group of magic using citizens under the purview of the [[Blackstaff]]. Magic can be dangerous in the wrong hands, and this group serves as a combination surveilance system and employment system that seeks to prevent dangerous magic users from blasting off in public, as well as harness the magic prowess of the city in times of need. Magic users are strongly encouraged to join and those who refuse are monitored and mistrusted by the other members and their contacts.
