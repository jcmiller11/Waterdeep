Waterdeep has a ton of guilds and they have a pretty tight rein on how business gets conducted in the city. They even have exclusivity rights to guild activity with the 13 Dragonmarked Houses and the Dragonmarked Guilds. The guilds are big shit in Waterdeep, but outside of it no one knows who they are.

Notable Members of The Guilds:

[[Merlyn]] from the Guild of Guilds.
