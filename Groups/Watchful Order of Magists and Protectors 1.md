A group of mages under the purview of the [[Blackstaff]] that can be called into service for the city.

The group acts as both a watchlist of magic users, and anyone who doesn't join is eyed with suspicion and may be subject to surveilance by the Order. Some members are more active in the group than others, and they host monthly get-togethers but are otherwise a relatively loose and uncollected list of magic using citizens dwelling in the city.

Recently the group has become aware of strange behavior exhibited by [[Meloon Wardragon]]

Notable Members:
[[Brass and Tax]]
[[Party]]
