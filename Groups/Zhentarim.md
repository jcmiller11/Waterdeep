Zhentarim is a criminal organization also known as The Black Network. They operate across the world, and illegally in most places, but in [[Waterdeep]] the Zhentarim has fractured due to their conflict with the [[X Guild]]. The Zhentarim was founded by a wizard named [[Manshoon]], and his simulacrum still controls the Black Network. 

The two Zhent factions in Waterdeep are broken along their allegiance with Manshoon. Manshoon wants to kill everyone in the X Guild, which will jeopardize the Network's business operations in Waterdeep, and so his loyalists are engaged in all out war with the X Guild. Meanwhile, Waterdeep's own separatists have spent years trying to build up a legitimate enterprise in Waterdeep, even gaining the acceptance of many nobles, guilds, and even some Lords, but this violence is completely undermining their efforts. Zhentarim Separatists have been hoping to uncover the[[Lost Dragons of Neverember]], in order to use it to help cement their legitimacy in the city.

Notable Members:
[[Manshoon]], the simulacrum of the powerful dead wizard himself.
[[Davil Starsong]], the leader of the Separatist faction of the Zhentarim.
[[Yagra Stonefist]], the half orc bodyguard.
[[Urstul Floxin]]
