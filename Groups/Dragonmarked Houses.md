The 13 Dragonmarked Houses are the biggest group of power players across the continent. Blessed with Dragonmarks, magical birthmarks that confer skill and even magical ability to certain heirs, the 13 Dragonmarked Houses gained immense political power and wealth using their special talents and Dragonmark Abilities. Not every member of a House has a dragonmark, they are very rare. In addition, people unrelated to the Houses can have dragonmarks, called Abberant Dragonmarks but these even rarer marks are feared and misunderstood.

The Houses maintain the Major Dragonmarked Guilds.

The Houses are as follows
Cannith - Mark of Making - Fabricators Guild and Tinkers Guild
Deneith - Mark of Sentinel - Blademarks Guild and Defenders Guild
Ghallanda - Mark of Hospitality - Hostelers Guild and Dragontail Guild - Halfling
Jorasco - Mark of Healing - Healers Guild - Halfling
Kundarak - Mark of Warding - Banking Guild and Warding Guild - Dwarf
Lyrandar - Mark of Storm - Raincallers Guild and Windwrights Guild - Halfelf
Medani - Mark of Detection - Warning Guild - Halfelf
Orien - Mark of Passage - Couriers Guild and Transportation Guild
Phiarlan - Mark of Shadow - Entertainers and Artisans Guild (spies) - Elf
Sivis - Mark of Scribing - Speakers Guild and Notaries Guild - Gnome
Tharashk - Mark of Finding - Finders Guild - Human but halforc
Thuranni - Mark of Shadow - Shadow Network - Elf
Vadalis - Mark of Handling - Handlers Guild

A previous house, House Vol (Mark of Death), used to exist, but they were wiped out.
In addition, some of those with Aberrant Dragonmarks have formed a house that they call House Tarkanan
