The Harpers are a group of people seeking to thwart real and would-be tyrants from gaining power. They are a secret group that operates in the shadows, but they have contacts with the government of Waterdeep and the rest of the world. They are a force for good in the world and work with many groups to assess threats to try to keep the world off the path of destruction. As they operate in secret, they often communicate through hidden means, such as [[paper birds]].

Notable members include:
[[Mirt]] A nobleman, former adventurer, and a [[Masked Lord]] of Waterdeep. Mirt invited the [[Party]] to join the Harpers.
[[Threestrings]], a halfling bard.
