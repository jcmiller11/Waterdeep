The X Guild is a criminal organization that seems to be centered in or near [[Waterdeep.]] Led by a mysterious leader named [[Mr. X]], The X Guild does big crimes and uses eye-based imagery in their dealings. They've been at war with the [[Zhentarim]] since the [[Stone Of Golorr]] was stolen from Mr. X by a dwarf working for [[Dagult Neverember]], as they inaccurately blamed the [[Zhentarim]] for the deed.

The X Guild has been committing more and more open violence and as such the City Guard has been extra militant about rounding up and jailing members.
